## Why is C++ called C++ and not ++C

- The postfix increment operator ++ signifies that the value is increased by 1 unit after evaluating the value of the expression.

- C++ was initially known as `C with classes` and was renamed in 1983 as `C++`, that is has most of the properties of C but is a step ahead.
