# CPP_Week6

### Problem 1 : 

`solution6_1.cpp`

Do you think your modifications are an improvement? Why or why not?

Changes like using shared_ptr() `(helps in memory management),` and creating copy constructor `(helps creating a deep copy)` improved the code implementation.

### Problem2 and Problem 3: 

`solution6_2.cpp`

### Problem 4: 

`solution6_4/LockFreeStack.h` `solution6_4/LockFreeStack.cpp`

### Problem 5: 

How high can you count on both hands?
